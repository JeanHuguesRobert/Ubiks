# Ubikial TODO List

## Development Methodology

This TODO list is managed through an iterative, AI-assisted development process:

1. **AI-First Planning**:
   - Tasks are analyzed by AI for complexity and dependencies
   - AI suggests optimal implementation approaches
   - Code structure recommendations are provided upfront
   - Each task includes AI-specific implementation notes
   - Prompt templates are created for common patterns

2. **Iterative Implementation**:
   - Each task is broken down into small, testable units
   - AI pair-programming assists with code generation
   - Continuous code review with AI validation
   - Prompt history is maintained for consistency
   - AI suggestions are version controlled

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - AI-assisted test case generation
   - Automated code quality checks
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - AI-driven code smell detection
   - Prompt effectiveness evaluation

4. **Documentation**:
   - Auto-generated documentation drafts
   - AI-enhanced code comments
   - Living documentation updates
   - Prompt template documentation
   - AI interaction patterns
